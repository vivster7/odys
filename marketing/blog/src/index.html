            Here's a brief story about software development.
          </p>
          <p class="ml-5 text-gray-600">
            It always starts with a problem. Something that needs fixing. A small, ragtag team of software engineers is
            brought on board to build a solution. The solution works and needs to scale. More engineers are brought on.
            Customers start asking for new features. The surface area of the product grows. The founding engineers leave
            to start something else. More engineers are brought on. The product continues to grow.
          </p>
          <p class="ml-5 text-gray-600">
            Development starts to slow. Building the application takes an hour. The tests can't run locally anymore.
            Bugs only get fixed if they affect enough customers. The latest technology is being tested in new
            repositories. Engineers start using the word "legacy". New engineers stop learning the old system. Employee
            churn continues. Eventually, no one really know how the whole thing works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Degradation is not inevitable. Time will not erode away the bits that compose our systems. But most software
            that you or I are working on today will be in worse shape a decade from now. There are many contributing
            factors but I want to talk about one: imperfect communication.

          <p>
            As engineers work, they build an understanding of the system -- a mental model of sorts. Onboarding new
            teammates involves sharing this mental model. In practice, only the outline of this model is shared. Its too
            detailed and nuanced to share completely. Individuals are responsible for filling in the gaps. As a
            result, team members are unlikely to have the same mental model.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ocassionally, parts of these models will synchronize. Sometimes it happens while reading documentation and
            it clicks. More often, it happens because a bug or an outage forces a team to reevaluate their understanding
            of the system. But as more code is written and the system grows, these models will inevitably diverge again.

            Teams with closely aligned mental models will develop better software. The software will have fewer bugs and
            be more resilient to changes. So its worth asking: How can we better keep our mental models synchronized?
            How can we detect discrepencies quicker?
          </p>
          <p class="mb-7">
            The whiteboard.systems app is an attempt to answer these question. It offers an alternative to keeping these
            models hidden away in our heads. It's a tool intended to bring these models to life. The app
            takes an opinionated approach about what details are necessary when describing a mental model (just boxes
            and arrows). This enables an extremely simple interface. Users can learn the tool in seconds and
            simultanesouly describe their model as their building it. Give it a try and let me know how it goes!
